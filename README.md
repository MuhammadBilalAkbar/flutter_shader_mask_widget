**Great Features**
- ShaderMask widget applies a mask generated by a Shader to its child. It can be used to apply effects such as gradients or images.
- It works similar to shimmer loading effect in Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift).

**Problems from Videos**
- Question: How to set image as shader using this widget? <br />
Answer: Just replace the child of ShaderMask with Image widget.
- Question: Is shimmer the shadow outline that appears while loading? <br />
Answer: Yes
- Question: Widget isn't shimmering while loading? <br />
Answer: Actually it shows for few seconds, and even on YouTube they are not animated shimmer effect!

## 3. Video Structure

**Main Points / Purpose Of Lesson**

1. A widget that applies a mask generated by a Shader to its child. For example, ShaderMask can be used to gradually fade out the edge of a child by using a ui.Gradient.linear mask. It can also show shimmer loading effect.
2. Main Points
    - ShaderMask widget can shade in LinearGradient, SweepGradient, and RadialGradient.
    - ShaderMask can shade text/image with colors. It can also make shimmer loading effect.
3. It is the best widget/class to shade text or image with beautiful animations and list of colors.

**The Structured Main Content**
1. Make a clean new project in flutter and inside a single screen add `text` in the `body` of `Scaffold`. Wrap that `text` widget with `ShaderMask` widget.
2. For this video:
    - No need of setup for Android & iOS
    - ShaderMask with `shaderCallback` type `LinearGradient`. `begin` and `end` properties declare the list of colors with beginning and end arrangement. `begin` is the offset at which stop 0.0 of the gradient is placed. `end` is the offset at which stop 1.0 of the gradient is placed.
    ```dart 
        body: Center(
          child: ShaderMask(
            blendMode: BlendMode.color,
            shaderCallback: (bounds) => const LinearGradient(
              begin: Alignment.topLeft,
              end: Alignment.bottomRight,
              colors: [
                Colors.red,
                Colors.green,
                Colors.blue,
              ],
            ).createShader(bounds),

            child: const Text('I\'m burning the memories'),
          ),
        ),
      );
    ```
    Output: <br />

    - ShaderMask with `shaderCallback` type `SweepGradient` using `pi` constant of `dart:math` library. `startAngle` is the angle in radians at which stop 0.0 of the gradient is placed. It defaults to 0.0. `endAngle` is the angle in radians at which stop 1.0 of the gradient is placed. It defaults to `math.pi * 2`. `transform` is GradientTransform that creates a sweep gradient.
    ```dart 
        body: Center(
          child: ShaderMask(
            blendMode: BlendMode.color,
            shaderCallback: (bounds) => const SweepGradient(
              startAngle: 0,
              endAngle: math.pi / 4,
              colors: [
                Colors.blue,
                Colors.red,
              ],
              transform: GradientRotation(math.pi),
            ).createShader(bounds),

            child: const Text('I\'m burning the memories'),
          ),
        ),
      );
    ```
    Output: <br />

    - ShaderMask with `shaderCallback` type `RadialGradient`. `center` is the center of the gradient, as an offset into the (-1.0, -1.0) x (1.0, 1.0) square describing the gradient which will be mapped onto the paint box. For this case `center: Alignment.topLeft,`, alignment starts from topLeft side of box. `tileMode` is how this gradient should tile the plane beyond the outer ring at radius pixels from the center.
    ```dart 
        body: Center(
          child: ShaderMask(
            blendMode: BlendMode.color,
            shaderCallback: (bounds) => RadialGradient(
              center: Alignment.topLeft,
              radius: 0.2,
              colors: [
                Colors.yellow,
                Colors.deepOrange.shade900,
              ],
              tileMode: TileMode.mirror,
            ).createShader(bounds),

            child: const Text('I\'m burning the memories'),
          ),
        ),
      );
    ```
    Output: <br />
